# Battery-

This Pebble watchapp is inspired from the wonderful [Battery+][1]
by Ycleptic Studios. While waiting for it to be ported on the Pebble
Time Round, `Battry-` gathers the same input data and make it directly
available.

So technically, it uses the activity tracker slot to gather all
battery-related events and store them into persistent storage. The
user-facing app retrieves the data and displays it in a simple menu.

`Battery-` is also available for rectangular Pebbles, for people who
would rather have the raw data to process themselves, instead of the
ready-to-use processed data showed by `Battery+`.
